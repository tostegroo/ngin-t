Tiles2D.js â€” A 2D game "physics" engine
=============

The aim of this project is to create a 2d "engine" for platform games that uses other 2d/3d graphics libraries like pixi.js and three.js for render

### Why do not use box2d instead?

Ok, box2d is amazing, I know that. But can be a overhead if you need something more simple and that's the main objective of tiles2D,
create a simple physics for 2d games, getting the max of performance of the browser.

Tiles2D uses 2 types of "bodies" to calculate collisions.

One: - like box2d - This type of body is a kind of float body, that needs to be calculated in all frames keeping in view all other bodies.

Second:  Tiles2D has a special type of body, the "Tile", with this kind of body the engine can calculate collisions much faster,
tiles have always the same width and height, so It can get the positions of the tiles using much less interactions per body.

Also It will implement a environment model to make ease to make vibrant and dynamic worlds for any game.

### What is the stage of development?

The tiles2D is a very young project, It's currently on pre-alpha stage and needs a lot of work to jump to beta, that's why I need some help.

### Setup and Documentation ###

Tiles2D is on very early stage of development, so there is no release for the main public, only source code for developers
but as soon as It became more complete and playable I will update this section with links for download

### Contribute ###

Want to be part of the tiles2D.js project? Great! All are welcome! We will get there quicker
together :) Whether you find a bug, have a great feature request or you fancy owning a task
from the road map above feel free to get in touch.

Make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/tostegroo/tiles2D.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before submitting changes.

### Current features ###

- Basic Dom-Sprite for debug
- Collisions only calculated on Rectangles
- Support for Keyboard and Gamepad
- Basic API (similar to the flash display list API)
- Tiled files loader (data only)

### Basic Usage Example ###

You can see a basic usage example file on eg/html/index.html

### How to build ###

This project uses grunt, babel, rollup

If you don't already have Node.js and NPM, go install them. Then, in the folder where you have cloned
the repository, install the build dependencies using npm:

```
$> npm install
```

Then, to build the source for test, run:

```
$> grunt dev
```

This will create a non-minified version at `dist/tiles2D.js`

To build a minified at `dist/tiles2D.min.js` and a non-minified version at `dist/tiles2D.js` you need to run:

```
$> grunt dist
```

### How to generate the documentation ###

It is not implemented yet, but as soon as tiles2D became more usable It will have a documentation to build.
